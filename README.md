# pp!catch
pp!catch is a pp calculator for the osu!catch gamemode. Uses the beatmap's ID (not the beatmapset) to calculate.

Based on formulas from [osu!performance](https://github.com/ppy/osu-performance) and the [api](https://github.com/ppy/osu-api/wiki)

## Quickstart
Just run the .pyw file to use the calculator.

## Developing
* mods support
* search by name (maybe not >.>)
* better UI
